### Red Wine Quality Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Red Wine EDA is a demonstration of the exploratory stage of data analysis and R programming ability. The project explores the relationship between the physiochemical properties and subjective quality ratings of 1599 samples of red wine through a series of visualizations. Variables of interest in creating a model to predict the quality ratings of red wines based on their physiochemical properties are suggested as a result of this analysis. Future analysis could flesh out just such a model in detail.
